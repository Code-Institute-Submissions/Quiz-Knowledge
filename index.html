      which is often called 'Eternal City', with 2.9 mio inhabitants Name:

      100 cents, before 2001: Italian Lira History: The country has a long
      history, as Rome was founded in 753 BC. After the Roman Empire broke down
      in 395 AD, there were many separate kingdoms and city states. Italy became
      one nation only in 1861 and since then the country also includes the
      islands of Sicily and Sardegna. The 'Kingdom of Italy' lasted from 1861
      until 1946. During the second World War, Italy's Prime Minister Benito
      Mussolini sided with the German Nazi regime. The Italian Republic was
      formed in 1946. Italy is founding member of the European Union (EU) and
      the NATO. Italian anthem National Day: 2 June (Festa della Repubblica)
      Flag: The colours are said to represent these virtues: hope (green), faith
      (white), and charity (red) National Symbols: Italian grey wolf (national
      animal), red rose or white lily (national flowers) and the white
      five-pointed star with a red border

      <ul>
        <li class="mt-5">
          Italy lies in Southern Europe and is one of the six founding countries
          of the European Union. Italy borders six countries: France, Austria,
          Switzerland, Slovenia, Vatican City and San Marino. A flight to
          Italy's capital city Rome takes roughly 2.5 hours from London/England,
          8 hours from New York/USA.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-5">
          Italy is easy to recognize on any world map, as the country is shaped
          like a high-heeled boot, as you can see on the map above. It looks
          like the boot is kicking a ball, which is the island of Sicily, don’t
          you think? The country is slightly larger in size than the UK, the
          Netherlands and Belgium combined and about as big as the state of
          Arizona/USA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Italy has more than 7 600 km/ 4 722 miles of coastline as the
          peninsula is located for a large part in the Mediterranean sea. Italy
          is popular for its many picturesque ports and sandy beaches.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-5">
          Italy has two bigger islands Sicily and Sardegna and many smaller
          islands such as Capri, Ischia and Elba.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Alps and the Apennines are the two main mountain ranges in Italy.
          In the North, the mountain range of the Alps separates Italy from the
          other European countries France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia.
          The highest mountains of Italy can be found in the Alps. The Dolomites
          are a part of the Alps mountain range in Italy's north and many of the
          peaks are above 3 000 m/9 843 ft. high!
        </li>

        <li>
          There are many lakes in northern Italy, then the country's landscape
          flattens in the Po Valley. The Apennines mountain range run all the
          way down the boot and separate the eastern and the western regions of
          the country. And did you know that in Italy, there are still active
          volcanos? In the South of Italy you will find Italy’s three active
          volcanoes: Vesuvius near Naples, Etna on Sicily and Stromboli off the
          Coast of Italy.

        </ul>
        <li>
          Rome: Italy's capital city is a wonderful place to learn about the
          Romans and ancient history as there are so many historic sites such as
          the Foro Romano with its ancient Roman ruins Venice: This is a 'lagoon
          city' in Northern Italy. The city is built on islands and known for
          its colourful carnival celebrations. Florence: The city in Tuscany is
          known for its arts museums and historic churches. Many of the great
          Italian artists such as Michelangelo or Leonardo da Vinci once lived
          in this city. Pisa: Experience the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This is
          really quite a sight! Ravenna: Famous for the ancient mosaics in the
          churches. The extensive decoration with mosaics that date back to the
          5th century are so stunning!
          <br />
          Tuscany: This is a popular tourist region with scenic countryside.
          There are lovely medieval towns such as San Gimignano, Lucca or
          Montepulciano Alps: Great for skiing, hiking and mountainside
          holidays. Plan to visit Bolzano’s Natural History Museum where you can
          marvel at Oetzi, the mummy from the Ice-age. Italy Facts: Did you know
          that Matera is the European Capital of Culture in 2019?

        <p>Italian people</p>
        <li>
          Italy is quite densely populated, with most people living in the
          country's north. The Po Valley, also referred to as Padan Plain, is an
          area with many industrial centres. Almost half of Italy's population
          live in the Po Valley. The Po Valley's biggest cities include Milan,
          Modena, Turin and Verona. Milan is the main industrial centre of Italy
          and also known to be one of the world's fashion capitals. Italy's
          extreme north and the major part of the south are mainly used for
          agriculture. In the north the main produce are dairy products and
          grains, while in the south mainly fruits and olives are harvested.
          <br />
          Italians lead a modern lifestyle especially in the urban centres but
          they also celebrate century-old cultural traditions. Famous festivals
          that are celebrated annually are the carnival celebrations before
          Lent. In Venice, these are said to originate in the 12th century.
          <br />
          The Palio in Siena is dating back to 1644 when the first horse race in
          the city's main square was held. And of course, Italians love soccer!
          The admittedly quite brutal Calcio storico match is still played and
          celebrated in Florence once a year. Calcio means soccer in Italian.
          The Italian soccer league is followed by many Italians abroad too:
          Inter Milan, Lazio Roma and Juventus Turin are just some of the
          Italian soccer teams which are favoured by Italians.
          <br />
          Soccer, skiing, cycling, surfing or motor racing are just some of the
          sports Italians have very strong interest in. The family is very
          important for Italians, where there are still many big families
          including grandparents, parents and children in the household.
          Italians love their food, which is usually prepared freshly by 'la
          mama', the mother, or the nonna, the grandmother.
